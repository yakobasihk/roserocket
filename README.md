# roserocket

Hello Rose Rocket, 
My name is Yakob Asihk. I applied for your Junior Software Engineer Position and was tasked with making this website. 

The files are all located here. You can easily run this app by saving the files somewhere and going to the folder and simply running node roserocket.js.

The app runs on Port 80 so if you go to localhost:80 you will see the app running. Also I've added a websocket server running on 8080 so make sure that port is open as well. I did this because trucking requires constant updates and you want your drivers and directors to all have the same information, and I though what better way than to have a websocket server.
